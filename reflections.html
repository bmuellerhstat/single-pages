                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">1</span> Our next step forward is to continue on this and improve it.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">2</span> In this project, our layout was very simple and we didn't use any complicated position or html so my next step is use multiple positions, floats and displays. My next steps are to learn how to use bootstrap
                    in order to make formatting and positioning much easier. Instead of having to make everything from scratch, I could start off with a grid that would help make everything line up properly.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">3</span> My next steps moving forward are to add more ultrasonic sensors so that the robot will be able to detect obstacles all around it, and not just the front.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">4</span> In the future i would use what I learned and put it into the project.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">5</span> I would like to give users the option to change the font style of the text in their banner and allow users to apply intricate designs to the background of their banner. In addition, I would like to allow users
                    to adjust the size of the text and banner.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">6</span> Work more on the project.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">7</span> My next steps would be revising this banner generator and adding more questions or more text boxes and putting all of that information on the banner and not just their name. I would like to make it have an
                    animation or a colorful heading and etc.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">8</span> For my next steps into the future, I hope to try a little harder coming up w/ something more original. I also want to push myself to go an extra mile as a coder. I also want to be able to help more people
                    out</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">9</span> In the future, maybe I will add and make changes to this page to make it better. Also, I will keep practicing html and css to one day possibly become a web designer, working for a company.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">10</span> I hope to use the newfound knowledge I have after completing the project to work on bigger and better projects, and I might even come back to make this project better.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">11</span> In the future I would like to find out how to make it so that the user is deducted points from the overall score. I would also like to add a concept in which the difficulty of the level increase, as a certain
                    number of time passes or a certain score is reached. Maybe if the score is greater than 500 or if x seconds pass, then increase the y speed.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">12</span> My next steps is to do more with what I have learned. I am certain there is much more to learn that I can use in the future so I will look for ways to improve and educate myself in the vast knowledge of coding.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">13</span> My next steps for moving forward is to make the bowling ball game more realistic by applying function map() to the code. This will make the game act like an actual bowling game because the pins will go in
                    a certain direction depending on where the user aims the pins. Also, I would like to turn this game into a two player game. This allows the user to play with someone else, which makes the game more entertaining for the user.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">14</span> I would want to take what I learned and create more web pages.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">15</span> My next steps are to edit this projects so that there would be more features and look more interesting.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">16</span> My next steps are to use what I learned to hopefully add onto previous projects as well as make new ones. Also another goal I would hope to accomplish is further my Web Design knowledge and try to fix all
                    the bugs that i have come across.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">17</span> My next step for moving forward is to learn how to use other data formulas such as googletranslate(), etc and be able to use different languages in Google sheets.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">18</span> My next steps for moving forward are to make something big with this little steps to put everything together to see what it could be create and helpful for people to use it.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">19</span> My next step is to fix the hover effect on the image because I actually got the code from an open source place so I had a very difficult time to add media query on it since there were a lot of layers to the
                    code. I didn't fix it because you can't see the hover effect on cellular device so it wasn't a major problem to us but I would like to make it perfect in the future.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">20</span> As a programmer, I want to learn more codes and concepts of coding. And if possible,I would like to add more codes to this project to improve it when I get to learn more codes.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">21</span> My next steps are to further my knowledge in software engineering by creating a challenging program for my next project.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">22</span> My next steps in moving forward is to continue to learn in this class. My goal is to learn as much as I can.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">23</span> To improve this project, the next step is to add other features to it to make it more challenging. I would like to add a gradual speed. By adding a gradual speed it would increase the difficulty for the user.
                    Also I would like to add a timer to it therefore the player can win the game.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">24</span> My next steps is trying to learn from other code in order to make more cool stuff. Also, I will learn from their code so I can modify my code to make it in order to make it cooler for the future.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">25</span> The next steps for us would to add more qualities and aspects, to make it more unique and stand out from the others. Since now we know for sure what we are doing.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">26</span> I really like this project and this game. I would like to improve it by continuing the code and making it a better game.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">27</span> My next step for this project is to create more details and to make it look better.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">28</span> In the future, I want to make something that is more advanced.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">29</span> My next steps would be to improve the color of the RGB so that it would become blue when the temperature is cold. I would also like the RGB to respond faster to the temperature. Lastly, I would change my
                    code to make it more efficient and get rid of any unnecessary code.</li>
                <li class='sortable-item'><span class="letter">30</span> My next steps is to learn more about 3D modelling and printing and knowing how to make more advanced projects. I will continue to practice on my own time to further my knowledge about the future of our world!</li>
